# Auto-Ecole Management System
Feel free to edit this file and/or modify it with new features
**Ideas**:
- **Use Icons instead of buttons** (kinda cool tbh)
## Emphasis on Threads and Parallel Programming
The application could leverages **multithreading and parallel programming** to enhance performance and responsiveness:
- **Background Tasks**: Real-time notifications for document expiration and session reminders
- **User Input Prioritization**: Ensures that while performing background tasks the system should remains highly responsive to user input providing a smooth user experience during form filling or navigation (Ayoub's Idea tho)
- **Data Processing**: Efficient data retrieval and updates in the dashboard using asynchronous threads

## Business Rules
### B6
- Each candidate should consistently use the same vehicle and  preferably  the same instructor for all practical sessions

### B7
- Vehicles older than 10 years must undergo a technical inspection every year
- Comprehensive history of each vehicle including repairs and maintenance  is maintained

### B8
- Future updates will include advanced features for tracking success rates and optimizing resource allocation

## Architecture
The application must use the layered Architecture (yall aleardy know this)


## UML Diagrams
Still don't know shit about this
