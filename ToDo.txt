Set up the exam inscriptions.
Note in the "Passer Examen Interface" :
*   maybe make the Frais d'examen read only (fills automatically after selecting the exam type).
 After finishing these the Candidat Usecases are all done.


 In the interface Session planification, ig it should add candidats automatically to the session when they are created. (based on the inscription (date and status) and max capacite)
